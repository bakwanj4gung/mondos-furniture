# Mondo's Furniture Slicing by Muhammad Faqih Ali

This project was designed by Ahmad Aulia, a design student at IDN Polytechnic.


## About This
I built this project with HTML 5 and CSS 3. It took 2 or 3 days (I forget) to build it, starting from the code writing process and ending with the implementation process. Initially this was just an assignment from my mentor at the Polytechnic. So, I just did it without knowing the benefits of this project. And recently, I realized it's useful for filling out my portfolio projects. So thank you very much Mr Febryan.
